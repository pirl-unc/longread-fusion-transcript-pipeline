This repository is a collection of modules written in bash that are used to run the simulated longread fusion transcript detector.

The `src` directory contains files relevant to the pipeline. The pipeline is meant to be run in the asscociated docker image located at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vantwisk/longread-fusion-transcript-pipeline/general.
